        <p>
            Today is a special day for me as it marks my <span>Birthday</span>, and I couldn't be more excited to share my life journey with you. Specifically, I'd love to take you through my experiences in the tech world and touch on my passion for music.

            My journey in the tech space has been a rollercoaster ride, full of exciting and challenging moments. I am still growing, and I'm thrilled to share my progress with you. However, before we proceed,  I want to make it clear that this webpage is not my portfolio website. I'm still in the process of building a full-stack web application with MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJs, and learning about data structures and algorithms so that I can solve more complex problems. So far, I've gained proficiency in JavaScript for dynamic web page interactions, and am working to improve my skills in Python, and C/C++ programming languages and Database Management.

            As much as I love tech, music will always be my first love. Thanks to God's favour, grace, and inspiration. I've had the opportunity to write over 100 songs! While I've only officially released two and have recorded four, I'm excited for the time and opportunity when I can record more and share my music with the world.

            I also run a blog,        <a href="https://chiditechstory.hashnode.dev/newsletter" target="_blank" class="text-link">chiditechstory</a>, where I write about how businesses can achieve success through tech. Although I have not been as consistent as expected, I am committed to learning and not missing out on any possibilities or opportunities that may help me improve my tech skills and ultimately share resourceful information with you.
